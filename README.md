# Backend with C# using APS.NET

In the following repository, you will find the source code for the backend project for the Million technical test. This backend application was developed with C# and ASP.NET, using MongoDB as the database.

For this application, I decided to use the Unit of Work design pattern to ensure that each entity has access to generic methods, ensuring a better development experience and a shorter time to create or update implementations within the code.

I decided to create a layered architecture for better code decoupling, ensuring better code order and quality.

This API is deployed in Azure using a Docker container.
